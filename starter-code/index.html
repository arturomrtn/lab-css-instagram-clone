  <h1> Capture and Share the World's Moments </h1>

 <p> Instagram is a <b>fast</b>, <b>beautiful</b> and <b>fun</b> way to share your life with friends and family.

  Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.

  Oh yeah, did we mention it's free? </p>
